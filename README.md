# ARTICULATE: A multipurpose AI speech Companion 

Articulation is an AI speech companion designed to assist users in improving their
communication skills, emotional well-being, and daily productivity. This project aims
to integrate speech recognition, emotion detection, and real-time feedback systems to
create a multi-functional tool to reach individuals, aiding them in enhancing their
speech clarity and specialized communication types and practicing general communication practices to improve themselves.
Articulate focuses on improving speech clarity, fluency, and confidence through personalized guidance and corrective feedback, further empowering users to communicate
with more ease.
We also aim to integrate a voice-driven task manager, allowing users to organize
their daily tasks using voice commands using NLP systems and allowing voice instructions to be converted to proper, clear actions. This functionality will be further
explored to allow for good integration with other productivity apps also.
As for accessibility, we aim to provide individuals with hearing impairments and
others who communicate with non-standard languages like American Sign Language
(ASL), enabling the system to translate speech into sign language through on-screen
avatars and offering real-time speech-to-text conversion for smoother communication
in diverse settings. An additional function of analyzing pitch and tone of speech amplification is to provide users feedback on their speech style, helping them to increase
their speaking abilities.
With AI and speech tech, Articulate strives to address real-world communication
challenges, helping people improve their speaking abilities, manage daily tasks, and
bridge the communication gap for individuals with disabilities by providing a usercentric solution approach for communicative needs.
